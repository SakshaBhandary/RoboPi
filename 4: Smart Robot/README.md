An advanced robot integrated with ROS2 and Nav2 for autonomous navigation in dynamic environments. It can perform SLAM and autonomously navigate through pre-mapped areas while avoiding obstacles in real-time.

**Robot Features :-**
1. **Customizable URDF Design:** Tailored robot designs with Fusion 360 integration for optimised hardware. 
2. **3D Visualization in RViz:** Visualizes robot location and sensor data in real-time.
3. **SLAM-Enabled Mapping:** Builds and updates maps of its surroundings autonomously.
4. **Autonomous Navigation:** Uses Nav2 for end-to-end autonomous movement in complex environments.
5. **Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance:** Responds dynamically to obstacles using advanced ROS2 capabilities.
