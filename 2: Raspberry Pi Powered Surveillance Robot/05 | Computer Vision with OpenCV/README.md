|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Image Loading & Display       | Reading and displaying images and videos                     |
| Color Spaces (BGR/HSV/Gray)   | Converting images to different color models for processing   |
| Thresholding & Masking        | Segmenting regions of interest based on pixel intensity      |
| Edge & Contour Detection      | Detecting shapes and boundaries (Canny, Sobel, contours)     |
| Object Detection (Color/Shape)| Tracking objects based on color or geometry                  |
| Motion Detection              | Identifying movement between frames                         |
| Face & Feature Detection      | Using Haar cascades or pretrained models                     |
| Drawing & Annotation          | Overlaying text, shapes, and highlights on live video        |
