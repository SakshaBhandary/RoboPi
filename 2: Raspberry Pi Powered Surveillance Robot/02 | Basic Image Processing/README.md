# Image Processing
Image processing is a technique used to enhance, analyze, or manipulate digital images using computer algorithms. It involves a series of operations performed on an image, either to improve its visual quality or to extract valuable information from it. This can include tasks like adjusting contrast, removing noise, or detecting objects within the image.

### 1. **Image Representation** 
Images are 2‑D arrays of pixels; each pixel stores color intensity values (e.g., 8‑bit per channel RGB → 0–255).

### 2. **Color Space Conversion** 
Converting RGB to Grayscale or HSV isolates luminance or color information, simplifying certain algorithms.

### 3. **Filtering (Convolution)** 
Applying kernels (e.g., blur, Sobel) modifies pixel values based on neighbors—useful for smoothing or edge extraction.

### 4. **Thresholding & Binary Images** 
Splitting pixels into foreground/background (0 or 255) enables contour detection and segmentation.

### 5. **Morphology** 
Erosion and dilation refine binary masks by shrinking or expanding white regions—commonly used after thresholding.
