# Smart Surveillance System <img width="25" height="25" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c5ef19b-2562-46da-96c5-2256b2f058d9" />

A Smart Surveillance System uses **cameras + computing** to automatically monitor environments, detect motion, recognize faces, identify objects, or send alerts without human supervision. These systems rely on **computer vision**, **machine learning**, and **embedded processing** to perform intelligent analysis of visual data.

## Camera Sensor Integration
Use camera modules (like PiCam, USB webcams, or IP cameras) to capture real-time video. These feed into processors like Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, or cloud servers.

## Object Detection & Tracking
Algorithms like **Haar Cascades**, **YOLO**, or **MobileNet SSD** are used to detect humans, faces, or custom objects in real-time, even under changing conditions.

## Event-Triggered Actions
Smart surveillance enables features like:
- Motion detection to start recording or send alerts
- Intruder recognition (facial or object-based)
- SMS/email notifications when specific events occur

## Embedded + Cloud Integration
Surveillance logic can run on edge devices (e.g., Jetson Nano for on-device AI), or send frames to a cloud server for processing/storage. Hybrid models also exist.
