Serial Communications is like a one-lane road, where the 1s and 0s are transmitted in single file. The speed of transmission is either referred to as the “BAUD” rate.

# PARALLEL COMMUNICATION

Parallel Communications is like a multi lane expressway, where the 1s and 0s are transmitted side by side.

# COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS

Communication protocols define the rules and standards for exchanging data between devices in embedded systems. Serial communication allows for transmitting data over a communication channel, where data is sent one bit at a time. Ex: UART, SPI, and I2C, each designed to meet different needs in terms of speed, complexity, and connectivity.
