A robot designed integrating foundational concepts of Electronics, Arduino, Sensor interfacing and Bluetooth control. It uses sensors to detect and follow paths, execute manual override possible via Bluetooth from a smartphone and is also capable of detecting obstacles to navigate through a maze. 


**Robot Features:-**
1.  **Modular Components:** Easy-to-add sensors or actuators for extended functionalities.
2. **Bluetooth Control:** Switch between autonomous and manual control modes via a smartphone app.
3. **Responsive Motor Control:** Smooth and precise motor movements for accurate path following.
4. **Obstacle Detection:** Uses proximity sensors to avoid obstacles in the maze.
5. **Maze Navigation:** Automatically detects paths and makes turns based on sensor feedback.
