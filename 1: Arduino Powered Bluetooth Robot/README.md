A robot designed integrating foundational concepts of electronics, Arduino, sensor interfacing and Bluetooth control. It uses sensors to detect and follow paths, execute manual override possible via Bluetooth from a smartphone and is also capable of detecting obstacles to navigate through a maze. 

Features:
1. Customizable URDF Design: Tailored robot designs with Fusion 360 integration for optimised hardware. 
2. 3D Visualization in RViz: Visualizes robot location and sensor data in real-time.
3. SLAM-Enabled Mapping: Builds and updates maps of its surroundings autonomously.
4. Autonomous Navigation: Uses Nav2 for end-to-end autonomous movement in complex environments.
5. Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance: Responds dynamically to obstacles using advanced ROS2 capabilities.
