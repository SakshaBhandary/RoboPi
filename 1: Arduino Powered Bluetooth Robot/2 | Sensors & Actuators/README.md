A sensor is a device which detects or measures a physical property and records, indicates, or otherwise responds to it.

## Working of Sensor

An IR (Infrared) sensor is a device that detects infrared radiation emitted by objects. It is commonly used for proximity sensing, object detection, and distance measurement by emitting and receiving infrared light.

## LDR SENSOR

An LDR sensor detects light intensity using a light-dependent resistor, which changes resistance based on the light level. It's used in applications like automatic lights and brightness sensors.

## TEMPERATURE & HUMIDITY SENSOR (DHT22)

A DHT sensor is a combined temperature and humidity sensor that provides calibrated digital output. The DHT family includes popular sensors like DHT11 and DHT22, which are widely used in projects for measuring environmental conditions.

## ULTRASONIC SENSOR (HC-SR04)

Ultrasonic sensors measure distance by emitting high-frequency sound waves that bounce off an object and return to the sensor. The time taken for the sound wave to return is used to calculate the distance.
