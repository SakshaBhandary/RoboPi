An IR (Infrared) sensor is a device that detects infrared radiation emitted by objects. It is commonly used for proximity sensing, object detection, and distance measurement by emitting and receiving infrared light.

## LDR SENSOR

An LDR sensor detects light intensity using a light-dependent resistor, which changes resistance based on the light level. It's used in applications like automatic lights and brightness sensors.
