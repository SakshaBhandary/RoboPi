A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that limits the flow of electric current in a circuit. It protects components and controls voltage, with its resistance measured in ohms (Î©).

## **2 | Capacitor**

A capacitor is a component that stores and releases electrical energy in a circuit. It helps smooth voltage and filter signals, with its storage capacity measured in farads (F).

## **3 | LED**

An LED (Light Emitting Diode) is a small electronic component that produces light when an electric current passes through it. LEDs are energy-efficient, long-lasting, and commonly used in displays, indicators, and lighting.

## **4 | Sensor**
