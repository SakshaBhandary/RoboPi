A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that limits the flow of electric current in a circuit. It protects components and controls voltage, with its resistance measured in ohms (Î©).

**2 | Capacitor**

A capacitor is a component that stores and releases electrical energy in a circuit. It helps smooth voltage and filter signals, with its storage capacity measured in farads (F).
