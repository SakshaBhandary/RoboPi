# Overview

This project involves creating a "Shy Robot" system using Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, and a servo motor. The robot's head automatically turns whenever an obstacle is detected, mimicking a "shy" response. Participants will build the robot using materials like plastic or cardboard to create a small, functional robot head. This project demonstrates how robotics can respond to environmental stimuli, enhancing engagement and demonstrating basic servo control and sensor interaction.

# Procedure

### **Steps to follow:**

1) Gather an Arduino board, an ultrasonic sensor, a servo motor, and materials like plastic or cardboard to build the robot's head. Include other necessary electronic components like wires and connectors.

2) Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino’s GPIO pins to detect obstacles by measuring the distance to objects. Connect the servo motor to another GPIO pin. Ensure proper power connections for the ultrasonic sensor and the servo motor (VCC, GND), and double-check the circuit wiring.

3) Power the Arduino using its USB cable connected to a power source. Set up the software environment by installing the necessary libraries to control the servo motor and read the ultrasonic sensor data.

4) Write an Arduino script that reads data from the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles. Implement logic within the script to control the servo motor. The robot’s head should turn away whenever an obstacle is detected within a certain range (e.g., less than 10 cm).

5) Upload and execute the Arduino script on the board. Test the system to ensure the robot’s head responds as expected to the detected obstacles. Troubleshoot any connectivity or hardware issues.

6) Demonstrate the robot in action, showing how its head turns away when an obstacle is detected, giving the impression of a "shy" response. Capture a short video (maximum 10 seconds) to document the working robot.

# Outcome

To develop a small "Shy Robot" using Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, and a servo motor. This project illustrates how robotic systems can interact with their environment and react to stimuli, such as obstacles, using simple materials like plastic or cardboard.
