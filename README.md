The Robot is a multi-functional and autonomous vehicle capable of following specified paths, recognizing and tracking objects, reading barcodes, navigating mazes, avoiding obstacles etc. It integrates sensors, computer vision, and SLAM for dynamic environment interaction and operates seamlessly with ROS2 for real-time data processing, navigation and decision-making. The Robot is built creating a progressive learning experience in robotics from emphasising integrated systems to preparing for advanced autonomous applications.

Robotics is the exciting intersection of science, engineering, and technology that brings machines to life. Robotics creates robots that mimic human actions, but better and faster. They're used in factories and other places for efficiency. With AI, robots are getting smarter and more capable.

## **Robotics Components:**
1. **The Robot's Body:** The mechanical construction, composed of joints and motors, is the robot's physical form, enabling it to move and interact with its environment.
2. **The Robot's Powerhouse:** Electrical components like batteries and circuits supply the energy and control signals that bring the robot to life.
3. **The Robot's Mind:** The software program is the intelligent core of the robot, dictating its actions and decision-making processes.

## **Robot Components:**
1. **The Robot's Mind:** The control system processes information and makes decisions.
2. **The Robot's Body:** The mechanical structure allows the robot to move and act.
3. **The Robot's Power Source:** The electrical system provides the energy for the robot's functions.
4. **The Robot's Senses:** The sensors gather information from the environment.
5. **The Robot's Programming:** The software defines the robot's capabilities and behaviors.

## **Robotics Applications**
