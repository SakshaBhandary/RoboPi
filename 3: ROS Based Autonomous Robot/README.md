A robot designed to autonomously follow a designated path and detect objects, leveraging ROS for robust sensor integration and navigation. The robot is ideal for mapping and navigation projects in controlled environments.

**Robot Features :-**
1. **ROS-Controlled Navigation:** Utilises ROS nodes for precise path-following.
2. **Sensor Fusion:** Combines data from multiple sensors for better navigation accuracy.
3. **SLAM for Mapping:** Maps the environment as it navigates, avoiding obstacles.
4. **Obstacle Detection and Response:** Detects objects in its path and operates accordingly.
5. **User-Defined Path Planning:** Capable of adjusting path based on user inputs in ROS.
