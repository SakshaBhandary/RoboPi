A robot with basic image processing capabilities for surveillance tasks, integrating a camera for computer vision based object tracking. It is designed for applications where remote monitoring and basic decision-making are required.

Robot Features :-
1. Modular Connectivity: Can be expanded to connect with additional surveillance tools or sensors. 
2. Basic Image Processing: Uses OpenCV for identifying and processing objects.
3. Real-Time Surveillance: Captures video feed and detects objects in its field of view.
4. Object Tracking: Locks onto and follows objects within the cameraâ€™s range.
5. Obstacle Avoidance: Avoids obstacles using both sensor and image data.
